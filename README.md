# monkebot

Hello! This is a casual Discord Bot that I created by Frankensteining multiple online tutorials together! I will try to gather them here, but
I also used some code from forum websites, such as stack overflow.

I maintain the bot through Replit and UptimeRobot. 

Here are some of the tutorials I used:

Additionally, some variables, such as my auth code, should be hidden through Replit's secret function and I recommend you do the same.

I made this bot for fun and enjoy having it spam the chat whenever I talk like a parrot and a pirate.

Known bugs:
- When using the help command, the prefix is showed as undefined.
